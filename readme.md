# XOR-SAT formulas and p-spin Ising model
This was produced as a project for a university course in Summer '19. 
It is based on M.MÃ©zard, F. Ricci-Tersenghi, R. Zecchina, *Two Solutions to Diluted p-Spin Models
and XORSAT Problems*, Journal of Statistical Physics, 2003.
Belief Propagation equations are implemented in their Min-Sum form to look for solutions to XOR-SAT instances drawn from a random ensemble. The problem is equivalent to that of finding the Ground State for a $p$-spin Ising model, i.e. an Ising model where spins interact not in pairs but in $p$-uples.
A brief explanation of the main results follows
